I built an interactive playlist creation application that allows users to search for songs, create custom playlists, and manage their music collections. The application uses MongoDB for efficient data storage and retrieval, enabling users to save their playlists and access them across sessions.

I integrated the Spotify API to provide comprehensive music search functionality, allowing users to find songs by title, artist, or album. The API integration also retrieves detailed music metadata including album artwork, track duration, and artist information, which enhances the user experience.

I implemented full playlist creation and management features, including the ability to add and remove songs, reorder tracks, and save multiple playlists. The user interface was designed to be intuitive and responsive, making it easy for users to organize and customize their music collections. The application provides a seamless experience for music discovery and playlist management.

**Technologies:** JavaScript, React, HTML/CSS, MongoDB
