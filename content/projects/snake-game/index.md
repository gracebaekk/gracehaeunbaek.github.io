I developed a fully playable classic Snake game implementation in C, featuring all the traditional gameplay mechanics that make the game engaging and challenging. The game includes grid-based gameplay with smooth movement and responsive speed controls that allow players to adjust the difficulty level.

I implemented comprehensive game logic including snake movement, food generation, collision detection for walls and the snake's own body, and score tracking. The user input handling system provides responsive controls that make the game feel smooth and playable.

I carefully managed dynamic memory allocation to handle the snake's growth as it consumes food, ensuring efficient memory usage and preventing memory leaks. This project provided excellent experience in C programming, game development, memory management, and implementing classic game mechanics from scratch.
