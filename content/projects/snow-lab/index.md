I redesigned the UC Berkeley Sierra Snow Lab website to provide a modern and intuitive interface for accessing real-time snowpack data. The project involved building a dynamic landing page that displays live snowpack metrics, allowing researchers and the public to easily monitor current conditions in the Sierra Nevada region.

I developed an interactive map visualization that shows all monitoring stations across the Sierra Nevada using geospatial data, enabling users to explore different locations and view station-specific information. To support administrative functionality, I implemented secure authentication and authorization systems that allow admin users to manage data and access restricted features.

Additionally, I designed and built CSV upload workflows that enable data overrides, giving administrators the ability to update or correct snowpack measurements when needed. The entire application was built with a focus on user experience, data accuracy, and system security.

**Technologies:** TypeScript, HTML/CSS, Next.js, React, Data Visualization
