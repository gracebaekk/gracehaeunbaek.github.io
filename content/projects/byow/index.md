I built a complete 2D tile-based world exploration engine in Java that allows users to create and explore procedurally generated worlds. The engine generates randomized worlds with interconnected rooms and hallways, creating unique layouts for each playthrough.

I implemented interactive avatar systems that allow players to navigate through the generated worlds, with smooth movement and collision detection. The project includes mini-game encounters that add variety and challenge to the exploration experience, making each world feel dynamic and engaging.

I developed a comprehensive user interface that enables users to create new worlds with custom seeds, save their progress, and load previously generated worlds. The world generation algorithm ensures that all rooms are accessible and connected, creating coherent and explorable environments. This project provided excellent experience in game engine design, procedural generation, and user interface development.
