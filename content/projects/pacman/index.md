I built intelligent Pac-Man agents using a variety of advanced AI algorithms and techniques. The project involved implementing multiple search algorithms including A* pathfinding, Minimax game theory strategies, and Q-Learning reinforcement learning approaches to create agents that could effectively navigate mazes and maximize game scores.

I developed a comprehensive game simulation environment that accurately models the classic Pac-Man gameplay, including maze navigation, ghost avoidance, and score optimization. The agents use probabilistic reasoning to predict ghost movements and make strategic decisions about when to collect pellets, avoid enemies, and pursue power-ups.

The reinforcement learning component allows the agents to learn optimal strategies through trial and error, improving their performance over time. This project provided hands-on experience with fundamental AI concepts including search algorithms, game theory, probabilistic reasoning, and machine learning techniques.
