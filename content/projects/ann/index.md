I implemented a complete artificial neural network from scratch using matrix multiplication functions written in RISC-V assembly language. This project involved processing images of handwritten digits and applying neural network algorithms to accurately identify and classify them.

I developed efficient matrix operations and mathematical algorithms that form the core of the neural network, including forward propagation, backpropagation, and activation functions. The implementation required careful attention to low-level programming details, including memory management, register allocation, and optimization techniques specific to RISC-V architecture.

The project provided deep experience with assembly language programming, understanding how high-level machine learning concepts translate to low-level hardware operations. I managed memory efficiently to handle large matrices and implemented mathematical operations that are typically abstracted away in high-level languages.
