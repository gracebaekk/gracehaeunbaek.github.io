I designed and implemented a complete two-stage pipelined RISC-V CPU simulator using Logisim, a digital circuit design tool. This project involved creating a functional processor that can execute RISC-V assembly instructions, providing hands-on experience with computer architecture and processor design.

I emulated all critical CPU components including the Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) for performing mathematical and logical operations, the register file for storing processor state, and comprehensive control logic that manages instruction execution and data flow. The pipeline design allows the processor to fetch and execute instructions simultaneously, improving overall performance.

The simulator successfully executes all standard RISC-V assembly instructions, demonstrating a complete understanding of instruction set architecture, processor design principles, and digital circuit implementation. This project provided deep insight into how modern processors work at the hardware level, from instruction decoding to execution and result storage.
