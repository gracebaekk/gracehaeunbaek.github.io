## 👋 About Me

I’m a **curious problem solver** who loves teaching and learning from others. I’m passionate about **computer science and education**, especially using technology to make learning more accessible and empowering for everyone.

When I’m not coding or exploring new ideas, you’ll probably find me blogging a new food spot 🍜, whisking matcha 🍵, or watching the latest animation movie 🎬.
